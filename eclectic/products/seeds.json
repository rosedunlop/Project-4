    "description": "These hand made cushions have been created using the traditional Shibori technique which is a form of resist or tie-dyeing. Available in a rich pink and blue to tie in with other cushions in the Damascene collection, these softly patterned textiles work well in both traditional and contemporary schemes. These stylish cushions have been made for us by the Jayshree organisation in Assam, who work to provide employment for struggling families. Jayshree started its journey with a small group of makers weaving and dyeing handloom textiles. The organisation has now expanded to 40 - 50 individuals who are constantly innovating and experimenting with new techniques and products. We are very pleased to be able to support Jayshree and contribute to its valuable work in the community.",

    "description": "Bring warmth to your scheme using our Small Darica Rug – a hand-tufted wool rug in soft, autumnal colours. Our take on the traditional Turkish floor covering features a bold pattern that combines a series of classic motifs; the 'yildiz' (star), representing happiness; kocboynuzu (the ram’s horn) that denotes power; and el (the hand), which offers protection from the evil eye. The wool used to make this rug has been vegetable dyed and treated with a herbal wash, before being left to dry naturally in the sun; the outcome of this process is a beautiful, antiqued finish",
